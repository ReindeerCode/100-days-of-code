### Day 1: 6/8/2021

**Today's Progress**: I started Hacker Ranks 10 Days of JS to get back in the swing of structured work. I did Day 1: Arithmetic Operators.

**Thoughts** :Started off by way over thinking it but after a few minutes realized it was easier than it looks and BOOM!

### Day 3: 

**Today's Progress**: Didn't have a lot of time today but I still got onto Hacker Rank to complete at least one challenge.

**Thoughts** : I initially did a standard If/Else statement but ended up with a more elegant solution using Math.ceil

### Day 4: 

**Today's Progress**: Fell short on time again today and was only able to get to Day 2: Conditional Statements: Switch on Hacker Rank

### Day 5: 6/14/2021

**Today's Progress**: Really fell behind the last few days as I went out of town then hurt my back. Got to it after work today though!

### Day 7: 6/16/2021

**Today's Progress**: Did the Day 3: Try, Catch, and Finally on Hacker Rank

**Thoughts** : I cannot remember ever doing this in the past and needed to do a good amount of googling. It is interesting and I need to try a few more problems like this.

### Day 9: 6/18/2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Day 4: Create a Rectangle Object problem on Hacker Rank

**Thoughts** This was a good one! I was confused what they were looking for at first but after some googling realized I could use Key Value pairs to create the rectangle.

### Day 9: 6/21/2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Day 4: Count Objects on Hacker Rank and MERN project.

**Thoughts** : Harder than it should have been for two reasons - one, read the directions a few times to make sure you understand what they are giving you, and two, do these more often!

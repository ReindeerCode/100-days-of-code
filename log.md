### Day 1: 6/8/2021

**Today's Progress**: I started Hacker Ranks 10 Days of JS to get back in the swing of structured work. I did Day 1: Arithmetic Operators.

**Thoughts** :Started off by way over thinking it but after a few minutes realized it was easier than it looks and BOOM!

### Day 3: 

**Today's Progress**: Didn't have a lot of time today but I still got onto Hacker Rank to complete at least one challenge.

**Thoughts** : I initially did a standard If/Else statement but ended up with a more elegant solution using Math.ceil

### Day 4: 

**Today's Progress**: Fell short on time again today and was only able to get to Day 2: Conditional Statements: Switch on Hacker Rank

**Thoughts** : I need to use Switch statements more often! I forgot how handy these are.

### Day 5: 6/14/2021

**Today's Progress**: Really fell behind the last few days as I went out of town then hurt my back. Got to it after work today though!

### Day 7: 6/16/2021

**Today's Progress**: Did the Day 3: Try, Catch, and Finally on Hacker Rank
